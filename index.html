					<strong>Average Daily Screen Time For Children,</strong> a project dedicated to exploring the impact of screen time on children. In todayâ€™s digital age, screens are everywhereâ€”from TVs to tablets and smartphones. But how much time do kids really spend on screens, and how does it affect them?

Through data analysis and visual storytelling, this project provides insights into screen habits, emotional impacts, and strategies for healthier digital engagement.

						<h2>Findings</h2>
						<h3>The Impact of Screen Time on Children's Behavior</h3>
						<p>According to collected data, screens are an integral part of modern childhood, with children aged 0â€“10 years spending an average of three hours daily engaging with digital devices.
							 Whether watching cartoons, playing games, or participating in interactive learning, screens shape the way kids consume entertainment and education. While technology offers valuable opportunities, 
							 parents are increasingly noticing its impact on behavior, emotions, and physical well-beingâ€”sometimes in positive ways, but often raising concerns about overuse and its long-term effects.</p>
							 <p>One of the most revealing insights is that TV remains the dominant screen choice, followed closely by tablets and smartphones. 
								While laptops and gaming consoles are also popular, 
								children tend to gravitate toward educational and entertainment content, watching videos, listening to music, or engaging with interactive apps.</p>

					<p>However, excessive screen time doesnâ€™t come without its challenges. Many parents report that their children experience 
						mood swings,irritability, frustration, and impatience, especially when transitioning away from screens. Some display stress and anxiety, while others become 
						aggressive,grumpy, or withdrawn.The physical effects are also noticeableâ€”trouble sleeping, eye strain, fatigue, 
						and even changes in diet and activity levels are common concerns linked to prolonged screen exposure.</p>
						<p>On the other hand, screen time isnâ€™t entirely negative. Some parents have observed positive outcomes, such as better memory, learning new words, 
							and improved focus when engaging with structured educational content. Digital tools can support 
							cognitive development when used mindfully, providing opportunities for children to absorb information in creative ways.</p>
							<p>To counteract the negative effects of excessive screen time, parents have introduced alternative activities to keep children engaged in offline play 
								and social interactions. Encouraging peer group play, storytelling, board games, outdoor activities, and structured routines has proven effective in promoting a healthier balance. Families also implement tech-free zones, 
								establish screen time limits, and model responsible digital habits themselvesâ€”creating a more mindful approach to technology.</p>

								<p>While screens are an unavoidable part of modern childhood, managing screen exposure thoughtfully is key. Finding a balance between technology use and real-world activities allows children to enjoy the benefits of digital learning 
									without compromising their emotional and physical health. With structured habits, parental guidance, and interactive alternatives, 
									children can navigate the digital world in a way that supports their overall development while minimizing the risks of overuse.</p>
